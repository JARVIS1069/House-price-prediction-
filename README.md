# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, etc. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict house prices using regression models.
- **Dataset**: Includes features like `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `location`, and more.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation with R² score and Mean Squared Error
- Predictions based on user input

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Linear Regression** was used as the primary model due to its interpretability and effectiveness for this use case.

## 📊 Visualizations

- Correlation heatmaps
- Pair plots
- Regression plots
- Distribution of price

## 📝 How to Use
